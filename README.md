<p>
This repository contains some C++ code that shows how to implement CORDIC math.  It is by no means an exhaustive production library.
</p>

<p>
CORDIC was invented in the 1950's and thus is nothing novel.  There is nothing proprietary here.
</p>

<p>
This is all open-source.  Refer to the LICENSE.md for licensing details.

<p>
To build and run the test:
</p>
<pre>
$ cd src
$ make
$ make _test_cordic.run
</pre>

<p>
TODO: add argument minimization and test more cases
